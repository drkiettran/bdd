Feature: Log Retention Period check

  Scenario: Verify log rention period is provisioned correctly
    Given I have a log group "my-log-group-2" retention policy ... passed in 0.001s
    When I retrieve the rention policy ... passed in 0.000s
    Then I should see that the retention in days is set to 30 ... passed in 0.000s
